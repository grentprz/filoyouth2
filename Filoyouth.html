      <h2>The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health Among Filipino Youth</h2>
      <p>In recent years, mental health has emerged as one of the most pressing issues affecting the youth in the Philippines. Many students face academic pressure, financial struggles, family problems, and the overwhelming influence of social media. Yet, despite the gravity of the issue, mental health remains heavily stigmatized. Young people often keep silent about their struggles, fearing judgment or being misunderstood.</p>
      <p>The pandemic worsened this problem. Isolation, uncertainty, and the abrupt shift to online classes led to heightened anxiety, depression, and burnout among students. Sadly, access to mental health professionals in the Philippines is still limited—especially in rural areas where clinics and trained counselors are scarce.</p>
      <p>This issue matters because mental health directly impacts education, productivity, and overall quality of life. A student who struggles internally cannot maximize his or her potential. As a nation, we cannot afford to neglect the minds and hearts of our youth.</p>
      <p>Solutions must include strengthening school-based counseling programs, training teachers to recognize warning signs, and expanding government initiatives like the Mental Health Law. More importantly, we must build a culture where asking for help is seen as strength, not weakness. Only when we break the silence can true healing begin.</p>

      <h2>Alab ng Paglaya (Flame of Freedom)</h2>
      <p>Beneath the skies of archipelagic blue,<br>
      Lies a people strong, resilient, true.<br>
      Chains may bind, and shadows stay,<br>
      But hope within will light the way.</p>
      <p>Freedom is not in swords alone,<br>
      But in the voice that calls our own.<br>
      In every youth who dares to stand,<br>
      For justice, love, and native land.</p>
      <p>Nationalism breathes in song and prayer,<br>
      In every hand that learns to share.<br>
      Change begins not far, but near,<br>
      Inside our hearts, steadfast and clear.</p>

      <h2>The Indispensable Role of Education in Nation-Building</h2>
      <p>Education has always been described as the key to success, but it is far more than just a means to earn a living. For me, education is empowerment. It shapes how we think, act, and contribute to society. It is through education that we learn not only facts and skills, but also values such as discipline, respect, and responsibility.</p>
      <p>In the Philippines, where poverty remains a challenge, education becomes even more valuable. A diploma may open doors to opportunities that can uplift an entire family. But beyond this, true education teaches us to question what is wrong, to seek what is just, and to dream of what is possible.</p>
      <p>I believe that education is not confined to classrooms; it continues in conversations, experiences, and even in mistakes. Every lesson equips us to face challenges and to be agents of change. That is why we must cherish it—not simply as a requirement, but as a gift that prepares us to serve others and our nation.</p>

      <h2>A Letter from Rizal to the Filipino Youth</h2>
      <p><em>Mga Kabataan,</em></p>
      <p>You are the fair hope of our beloved nation. In your hearts burn the fire of courage, and in your minds rests the promise of a brighter tomorrow. The Philippines has endured trials across centuries, yet it is in your hands that her destiny now lies.</p>
      <p>Do not be swayed by apathy or indifference. Strive to cultivate knowledge, for wisdom is the sword that cuts the roots of ignorance. Let not selfishness guide your actions, but rather a love for our people and our land. Remember, the greatness of a nation is not built by one hero alone, but by the collective will of its youth.</p>
      <p>Value freedom, but also the responsibility that comes with it. In every decision you make, ask yourself: does this uplift others, or only myself? The progress of our country depends on unity, discipline, and a deep sense of justice.</p>
      <p>Take courage, young Filipinos. Be the writers of new stories, the builders of new foundations, and the guardians of truth. In you rests my hope, and in you the Philippines shall find her glory.</p>
      <p><em>— José Rizal</em></p>
